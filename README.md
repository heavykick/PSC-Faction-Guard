# PSC-Faction-Guard
Tools for Elite: Dangerous alliance Pegasus Sector Commonwealth

This is a plugin for EDMarketConnector. The plugin is implementing the interface as descripted in: https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/blob/master/PLUGINS.md

The whole project is in work and will be happy about any contributor.


Vision: We want to update our faction members and inform them about available missions and news. They can participate at missions and update the mission status directly from ed-market-connector. We also plan to inform our commanders about contacts. So when you meet another PSC commander or an enemy of ours the plugin can inform you.
